# Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this web site is to create a portolio page that prospective employers can view.

The page showcases various attributes such as:
- Responsive design (including both media queries and flex)
- Links to applications
- Contact Me form

Although the page is live and meets the success criteria, there are still things to improve:

- Need better command of flex to guide where pages wrap
- Need better command of how to combine elements in rows and columns to create the proper layout
